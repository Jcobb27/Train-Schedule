# Train-Schedule
Created by Jennifer Cobb using HTML, CSS, JQuery, Firebase, and Moment.js. Firebase is used as cloud storage for the train data added by users. Moment.js is used to calculate the train's next arrival based on user input.

# Instructions
In the "Add Train" form, type in a "Train Name", "Destination", "First Train Time", and "Frequency". Then click submit to see the new train added to the train schedule, with the "next arrival" and "minutes away" calculated based on the current time.
